## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a more optimal way to create responsive navbars. I prioritized mobiile-first.


### Continued development

Implementing the onclick states would be much easier with React. I need to continue refining my RWD process.
